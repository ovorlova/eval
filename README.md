# eval
This code is based on https://github.com/leonid-pishchulin/poseval/

To calculate PCKh and AP metrics, use files **evaluatePCKh.py** and **evaluateAP.py** respectively. To run these files, you need annotations and predictions in format of MPII annotations.

To analyze correlation between scores (or number of predictions) and metric values, use **test.py**. All necessary arguments to run script are described inside the file.

To calculate average testing time without outliers, use **check time.ipynb**.
